## Introduction
Repository for ML code for neutrino particle detection . 

Categorisation of particle interactions observed in detectors is a core problem in experimental high-energy particle physics (HEP); typically, categorisation is achieved using machine learning algorithms applied to reconstructed components such as tracks, showers, and jets associated with specific particle interactions and energies. While these techniques have successfully allowed HEP physicist to characterise much of prior particle interactions, they are prone to two flaws highlighted in the Journal of Instruments: “mistakes in the reconstruction of high-level features can lead to incorrect categorization of the physics of the event, and the features used to characterize the events are limited to those which have already been imagined for the experiment”. 
 
Alternatively, we look to replace this methodology with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) which have a wide breadth of application in feature learning and categorisation problems therefore playing a pivotal role in image recognition and analysis. What follows is an application of these technics to the problem of identifying particle interactions in high energy neutrino physics, specifically NOvA-like neutrino detector images. The discussion includes an overview of the core concepts of CNNs and deep learning, the techniques used to build and train these networks including using feature extraction and machine learning algorithm, then the application of those concepts to specific example of identifying NOvA-like neutrino interactions based on visual topology

## Running Simulator
The code can be used to characterise neutrino events, all in self contained jupyter notebooks.
